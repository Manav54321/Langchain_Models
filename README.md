Here’s a 🔬 **researcher-style, beautifully structured `README.md`** for your project. It blends clarity, academic tone, and visuals—while staying practical for devs or learners exploring vector search or embeddings.

## 🧠 Document Similarity Search Using Embeddings

A Streamlit-powered demo that showcases how **vector embeddings** and **cosine similarity** can be used to find semantically similar documents — powered by Hugging Face transformers.

---

### 📌 Overview

Traditional keyword-based search often fails to capture meaning. This project demonstrates a modern approach — **Document Similarity Search** — where both documents and queries are converted into high-dimensional **vector embeddings**. These embeddings represent the *meaning* of text, enabling machines to compare based on context rather than just keywords.

---

### 🔍 How It Works

#### 1. **Embedding the Text**

Using [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2), each document and the user query are converted into vector representations:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/assets/embedding_diagram.png" alt="Embedding diagram" width="500"/>
</div>

These vectors live in a high-dimensional space (\~384 dimensions), where similar meanings are closer together.

#### 2. **Cosine Similarity**

To compare the vectors, we use **cosine similarity**:

$$
\text{similarity}(A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
$$

This gives a score from -1 to 1. The higher the score, the more similar the meanings.

#### 3. **Result Ranking**

The top-matching document is selected based on similarity, and returned to the user.

### 📊 Visual Representation

The following plot shows how documents and the user query are embedded and compared:

</div>

* 🔵 = Document vectors
* 🔴 = Query vector
* Proximity = Semantic similarity

We use **PCA** or **2D projection** for visualization.

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-similarity-search
cd document-similarity-search
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

> **Note**: Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed, along with `sentence-transformers`.

### 🧪 Example Query

```text
"Who's Ana de Armas?"
```

🟰 Returns the document:

> *"Ana de Armas exudes natural elegance and allure — her soft features, accent, and poise make her captivating on and off screen."*

Along with a similarity score like: `0.86`

### 💡 Real-World Applications

* **AI Chatbots**: Retrieve context-aware responses
* **PDF Q\&A**: Find the most relevant section in a document
* **E-commerce**: Recommend similar products
* **Legal/Medical Search**: Extract relevant cases or diagnoses

### 👨‍🔬 Research-Driven Motivation

This project is inspired by foundational ideas in **semantic search**, **transformer-based embeddings**, and **information retrieval**. It reflects the transition from surface-level keyword matching to meaning-aware vector search.
